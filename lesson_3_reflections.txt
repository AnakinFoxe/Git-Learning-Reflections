When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?



Git Commands:
git remote                      Display available remote repositories
           -v                   in verbose mode
           add <name> <url>     Add a remote with <name> and <url>
git push <remote> <branch>      Push <branch> to <remote>
