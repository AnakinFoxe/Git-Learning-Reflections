What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
>> A folder named .git is created when initializing a repository.
>> This folder contains all the meta data, history and other info about the
>> repository.
>> Why do we need to init a repo? That's basically how we create a repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
>> Staging area contains uncommitted changes of the repo, while the working
>> directory contains everything of the project, including committed changes,
>> uncommitted changes, and files not added to the repo.
>> Staging area acts like a buffer, between uncommitted changes and repository;
>> it also acts like container, separates the uncommitted changes from working
>> directory.
